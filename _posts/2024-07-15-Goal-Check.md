title: Goals Check-in & Update

### Update
Wassup blog we are approaching the end of the of program's alotted time in Santa Cruz and can I say it went by super fast. I rember first coming to the apartments and not knowing how long a month would actually take but now I am almost there with today being the first day of the last week. I have truly been enjoying my time here and the west coast culture, I am grateful to even be in this position to take part in this program, and all the mentors and supervisors making this possible as well. The past week we have been focusing on how to work in the workflow and getting some practice with it by using a development area, and following certain steps like synchronizing the local branch from the upstream branch as well as create feature branches to work on specific issues to make sure we are not toucjing other parts of the project.

### Goals Check-in
Currently one of my biggest goals that I have imposed on myself for the recent weeks is imporving my communication. I feel as though I have become a little bit more better when having to open myself up in lab during discussion on a certain topic such as "Pull Requests v.s. Merge Request" having that interaction in lab and discussing among my other cohort members allows me to better understand the topic and be able to distinguish between the two. I've been trying to hold myself accountable of interacting more and putting my piece into the conversation if I feel it may beneficial/relevant to the conversation. Another one of my goals that I mentioned in my earlier post was better understanding the components of open source and I can confidently say I have reached that goal. I feel like I know an extensive amount of information about open source and its only been about one month. The open-source concept is very easy to wrap your head around but there is a lot of context and accompanying parts that make open source what it is and if you want to be a contributor to a project of intrest you must have a good understanding of everything.

The recent weeks have taught me a whole bunch about open source and computer science as a whole, I have downloaded a bunch of new programs onto my laptop that I'm sure will be useful in my future comp sci career, learned and interacted with a lot of beneficial tools the open source contributors may use, opened and evaluated real life open source projects, and much more. It's a little unfortunate that the progrma will be ending soon but I'm so glad to have taken in everything that was taught and given to me whilst I was on this trip.

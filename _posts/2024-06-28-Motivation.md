Hey Blog one challenge that I want to impact with technology is better protecting data and systems from cyber threats. With my focus in computer science being cyber security I want to be able to make solid impact for whatever company I may end up working for and have my work stand out and show results. When I'm successful the first person that I want to tell about it is my mother, she has been a very influential part of my life and one of the major reasons why I decided to get into the computer science field in the first place. Being able to show her how much I have accomplished will bring me a wholesome/completed feeling because she alao knows what its like dealing with computer science. Some notable open-source projects in the cyber security field could be Metasploit Framework, Wireshark, Snort, OpenVAS, and many more that I found searching up on Google.

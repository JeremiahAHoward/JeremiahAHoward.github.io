title: p5.js Project Evaluation
---

Waassup Blog back here with another post, I'm pretty sure I am going into my third week of being in Santa Cruz and I am really enjoying my time. The colors are much more vibrant than back in Norfolk and I never realized how much I would enjoy going on hikes and taking in the the views. I am so glad to have been able to be apart of this cohort and I am excited for what is to come for us towards the end.

Today I am posting about a bigger project called p5.js that me and my partner Kemon researched before the end of the past week.

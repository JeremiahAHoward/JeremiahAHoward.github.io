Good Afternoon today's blog will be focusing on goalsetting for the remainder of time I will be in Santa Cruz. My name is Jeremiah Howard and I was born in Brooklyn, New York in 2004 and lived there until 2012 when I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina in which I stayed and was raised there. I first attended Norfolk State University in 2022 in whiched I joined the "Spartan Legion" Marching Band and majored in Computer Science, now as I am entering my third year at NSU my major has slightly shifted to a focus in Cybersecurity and I am projected to graduate May 2026. Coming to this internship will be my first time dealing with anything open source related, I'm eager to continue to learn and understand the elements of open-source. One of my stongest characteristics that I have is my ability to problem solve, even though it may take me a longer than most to have to solve a question fast once I'm given the time to solve something I am able to break it down and be able to fully understand the problem and the components to why it was such an issue. One skill I want to improve upon is the ability to communicate when needed, I know for myself I don't like to ask certain questions because it may seem like I'm not knowledgable about a certain topic. I have to start understanding though if I never ask the question I'll never know anything about that topic so I must begin to put my pride aside and start asking for help when I need it instead of struggling and getting frustrated. To get over this hurddle I believe I just need to ask any many questions as possible to get comfortable as well as a better understanding of everything.

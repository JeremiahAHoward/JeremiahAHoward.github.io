I am a Junior Computer Science student with a focus in cybersecurity, I currently attend Norfolk State University and march for the "Spartan Legion". I am a Spr.24 initiate of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity. I am excited to pick up and learn new things about coding and software programming in general.

### More Information

I was born in Brooklyn, New York but was raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. I love to binge watch shows and I am a fan of anime. I recently have fell in love with bowling and I enjoy playing any kind of sports. I can play multiple instruments but the instrument that I march with as of right now is called the euphonium.
